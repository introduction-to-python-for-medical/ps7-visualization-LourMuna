From the graph the Iris-Setosa seem to have the shortest sepal length ranging from approximetly 4.3 - 5.7. The Iris-versicolor plants range from 4.7-7.2, we can also see a mild gap between the lengths 5.2-5.4. As for the Iris-virginica the length of the petal has the widest range, starting from approximetly 5 up to 8.
